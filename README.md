This crate is an experiment with Slint. I'm wanting to make a Minecraft launcher (well, really a deterministic modpack builder) and exploring Rust crates for the frontend.

Currently, there's no Rust code in this repository, it is all Slint UI files. I was going to redesign the Slint standard widgets and re-write their backend implementations to share more code.

As it stands, I redesigned buttons. They're very pretty, and have many colorways.
